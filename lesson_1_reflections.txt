How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
-Diff showed only the sections that changed, so it was easier to find the
inadvertent change  (the typo)


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
-It can make collaborations easier with other people. Also, it can revert
to working versions of a software.
