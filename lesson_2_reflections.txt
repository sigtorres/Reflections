What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-it creates a hidden git file where it will track all the changes in the files
you add to the repository. You have to do this so you can start keeping track
of changes with git!


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
 -the staging area is an intermediate "directory" where files from the working
 directory that are going to be added to the repository are shown before they
 actually are added. This is useful to create logical commits when you have
 more than one change that have to go on separate commits (per logical change)
