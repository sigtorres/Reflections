When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-whenever you have to collaborate with people that are not at your location, or when you yourself
are not at the repository's location

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-because you may have some changes that may consist of several commits and you
may need more time to organize them before pushing or pulling to and form
github
